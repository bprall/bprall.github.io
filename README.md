# Personal-Website

Welcome to the repository for my [personal website](https://bprall.github.io). This website, built using React and Vite, dynamically generates content through a JSON file (`data.json`), enabling real-time updates and a responsive design. Key features include a global search bar, a responsive layout with CSS Grid, and an off-canvas navbar for mobile navigation.

## Project Overview

This project has a tech stack that includes TypeScript (TSX), React, Node.js, React Router DOM, Vite, and Firebase. Hereâ€™s what the website offers:

- **Dynamic Content Updates:** Seamless content updates without full page reloads, powered by a JSON file.
