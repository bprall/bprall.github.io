# Personal-Website
The code for my [personal website](https://bprall.github.io) built usaing React + Vite. The site can be easily updated through the use of a JSON file (`data.json`) that dynamically generates content on the pages. The site is designed to reformat based on device size, achieved through CSS Grid and a secondary off-canvas navbar. It also includes a global search bar that can search site-wide or by specific pages.

All code was written by Blake Prall
