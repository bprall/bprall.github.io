This project, which you are currently navigating, showcases my skills in web development and my ability to create dynamic, user-friendly interfaces. The website is built using a robust tech stack that includes TypeScript (TSX), React, Node.js, React Router DOM, Vite, and Firebase. Each of these technologies plays a crucial role in ensuring the site is both functional and efficient.<br>&emsp;One of the standout features of this website is its dynamic content rewriting capability. This means that the content on the site can be updated in real-time without requiring a full page reload, providing a seamless user experience. Additionally, the website is designed to be fully responsive, automatically adjusting its layout based on the screen size of the device being used. This is achieved through the use of CSS Grid, which allows for flexible and adaptive page layouts. For mobile users, I have implemented an offcanvas navbar that provides easy navigation without taking up valuable screen space.<br>&emsp;The website also includes a powerful global search functionality. This feature allows users to quickly find the information they are looking for by actively showing matches to their search queries and routing them to the relevant pages. The search bar is highly versatile, enabling users to search for specific content on individual pages through a dropdown menu. This ensures that all the information on the site is easily accessible and searchable.<br>&emsp;One of the key aspects of this project is its ease of content management. Almost all the content on the site, including news, projects, about me, the home page, and contact information, can be updated simply by modifying a JSON file. This not only makes the site highly maintainable but also ensures that new data is immediately searchable through the global search bar. This level of flexibility is particularly beneficial for keeping the site up-to-date with minimal effort.<br>&emsp;In terms of security and user authentication, I have integrated Firebase for login functionality. This allows users to securely log in to view the source code and other restricted content. Firebase provides a reliable and scalable solution for managing user authentication, ensuring that only authorized users have access to sensitive information.<br>&emsp;Overall, this personal website project is a testament to my skills in modern web development. It combines a range of advanced features and technologies to create a site that is not only visually appealing but also highly functional and user-friendly. By leveraging tools like React, Node.js, and Firebase, I have been able to build a platform that effectively showcases my professional experience and technical expertise. This project highlights my ability to design and implement complex web applications, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio."

The idea of being able to transform a small, affordable computer like the Raspberry Pi into a mobile platform that could play classic games sounded awesome. It was a challenging yet rewarding journey that allowed me to explore my passion for both gaming and tinkering with technology.<br>&emsp;The first step in this endeavor was selecting the right Raspberry Pi model and gathering the necessary components. After some research, I settled on the Raspberry Pi 4 for its improved processing power and versatility. Then, I acquired a high-quality microSD card to store the emulator software and game ROMs and a power supply.<br>&emsp;But I didn't stop there; I wanted to take this project to the next level. Inspired by a desire to make the gaming experience more immersive and portable, I decided to 3D print a custom game case. I designed a compact case that perfectly accommodated the Raspberry Pi, microSD card, and power supply. The case was not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing, reminiscent of a handheld gaming device (despite not having on-board controls).<br>&emsp;The real magic happened when I integrated a small LED screen into the design. The LED screen was strategically placed on the top cover of the case, allowing for a visual display of the games. To power the whole setup, I added a set of rechargeable batteries inside the case. The result was a self-contained, portable gaming device, complete with a screen and battery pack.<br>&emsp;Seeing the LED screen light up with the games and feeling the weight of the 3D-printed game case in my hands was a truly gratifying moment. I had transformed a simple Raspberry Pi into a handheld gaming emulator that could be taken anywhere, untethered from power sources. Navigating through game menus, selecting titles, and experiencing the nostalgia of classic games on a self-created device was a unique and immensely satisfying experience.<br>&emsp;In the end, this fun project was a testament to the versatility and creativity that the Raspberry Pi encourages. It allowed me to indulge in my passion for gaming, explore the world of emulation, and discover the potential of a tiny, affordable computer like the Raspberry Pi. It was not just about recreating games; it was about reliving childhood memories and learning new skills along the way. This project stands as a reminder that, in the world of technology and tinkering, even the most whimsical ideas can lead to rewarding and enjoyable experiences, while simultaneously showcasing the power of 3D printing and creative problem-solving."
